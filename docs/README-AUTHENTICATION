        README FOR AUTHENTICATION
    ************************************

Authentication can be enabled to provide protection for your application. Logon
is disabled by default, but can be enabled with some simple steps.

** SITE CONFIG:

    Open config/defaults.site and enable the authentication section. You need to
    tweak the locations (logon/logoff) to match your installation:

        'auth'      => array(
                'start'  => '/',                      // Start page after successful logon
                'logon'  => '/logon',                 // The logon page
                'logoff' => '/logoff',                // The logoff page
                'config' => __DIR__ . '/auth.inc',    // Config file for authenticators
                'sso'    => true                      // Enable SSO login
        ),

    This enables on-demand authentication forcing users to authenticate whenever
    required. If you like to show the logon icon, then it has to be enabled in the
    toolbox:

        'tools' => array(
            ...
                  'auth'      => true,    // Enable authentication box.
        ),

** INSTALL FILES:

    Use the uup-site.sh script for installing the auth directory (containing
    support files) into the public directory. If batchelor was deployed using
    composer, then simply run this command:

        bash$> ./vendor/bin/uup-site.sh --location /batchelor2 --auth

    You should now have the required support file installed under your public
    directory:

        public/auth/
        ├── logoff
        │   ├── authent.phtml
        │   ├── completed.phtml
        │   ├── destroy.phtml
        │   └── index.php
        └── logon
            ├── form.phtml
            ├── index.php
            ├── normal.phtml
            ├── secure.phtml
            └── select.phtml


** AUTHENTICATORS:

    Which authenticators and access restrictions to use is configured inside the
    config/auth.inc file. This file returns an array that configures a stack of
    objects for authentication and authorization.

    Typical you like to enable one or more authenticators in the auth sub chain
    and perhaps enable some access restriction. The latter can i.e. be used to
    only allow access from specific domains.

** FURTHER READING:

    The autentication framework is handled by external packages: uup-auth and
    uup-site. Both of them are installed as dependencies of batchelor when 
    running composer update, see the vendors directory.

** AUTHENTICATION:

    Derive your controllers from the SecurePage or SecureService classes from 
    uup-site to enforce authentication. 

    Batchelor provides and uses controller base classes that injects the security 
    context that can be retrieved from the security service. These controller are
    not enforcing authentication.

** AUTHORIZATION:

    The core batchelor don't use authorization. For those requiring it, the access 
    control list (ACL) framework in system security access could be used.
    
    See source/Batchelor/System/Security/Access.php for details.
