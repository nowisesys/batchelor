<h3>Java client</h3>
<p>
    We will develop a simple java client and call some methods in the queue API.
    It's assumed that you have some basic knowledge about programming in Java.
</p>

<h4>Java (wsimport)</h4>
<p>
    Generate proxy classes for the queue API using wsimport:
</p>
<div class="w3-code">
    <bash>mkdir classes sources</bash><br>
    <bash>wsimport -d classes -s sources -p batchelor.soap <?= $this->config->getUrl("api/soap/", true) ?>?wsdl=1</bash><br>
    <span>parsing WSDL...</span><br>
    <span>Generating code...</span><br>
    <span>Compiling code...</span><br>
</div>

<h4>Add main class</h4>
<p>
    Change directory to sources and use your favorite editor to create a file 
    named client.java inside the batchelor directory.
</p>
<div class="w3-code">
    <bash>cd sources</bash><br>
    <bash>jed batchelor/client.java</bash><br>
</div>
<p>
    This class will contain our main() method, the starting point when running 
    the application.
</p>

<h4>Compiling</h4>
<p>
    The compiled SOAP proxy classes is located in the classes directory and need
    to be included:
</p>
<div class="w3-code">
    <bash>javac -cp ../classes batchelor/client.java</bash><br>
</div>

<h4>Running</h4>
<p>
    When running the application, both classes and current directory need to 
    be included to satisfy packages search path.
</p>
<div class="w3-code">
    <bash>java -cp ../classes:. batchelor/Client</bash><br>
</div>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>
    First code example simply retrieves the API version from remote server, 
    while the second is a bit more complex and both fetches queued jobs and 
    enqueue a new job.
</p>

<?php
UUP\Web\Component\Script\CodeBox::outputFile($this->params->getParam("file", "client1.java"), false, [
        "client1.java", "client2.java", "output.txt"
])

?>

<p>
    Output from running client2.java should look something like this:
</p>
<pre class="w3-code">
