** GENERAL:

   Place the content of this directory outside the webroot (usually 
   /var/lib/http/htdocs). Read the notes inside conf/apache.conf. Make sure 
   the directory cache is writable by the user the apache server is running as.

   *) The only directory writable by the webserver should be the cache directory.
   *) Only source directory should be direct accessable from the web.

   Example:
   
   /var/lib/http/
             +-- apps/                      // Webapps like retrotector goes here
	     |     +-- retrotector/
	     |             +-- cache/       // Can be moved, see conf/config.inc 
	     |             +-- conf/
	     |             +-- include/  
	     |             +-- source/      // Aliased in Apache conf, see conf/apache.conf
	     +-- cgi-bin/
	     +-- htdocs/                    // The standard webroot, plain HTML
	     +-- error/                     // Apache internal
	     +-- icons/                     // Apache internal


** REQUIREMENTS:

   The code has been tested to work with:
   
   *) PHP 5.2.4 (PHP 4.4.x is being phased out, see http://www.php.net/)
   *) Apache 2.2.6 (http://httpd.apache.org/)
   *) The UNIX at daemon 3.1.8 (ftp://jurix.jura.uni-sb.de/pub/jurix/source/chroot/appl/at/)
   
   The PECL zip extension (bundled with PHP >= 5.2.x) is recommended. The
   code is also prepared to use an external zip command, like 7-zip. 7-zip is
   GPL/BSD licensed and can be downloaded from http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/.
   

** THE CACHE DIRECTORY:

   All job gets spooled under cache like this:

   retrotector/
        +-- cache/
              +-- hostid1/                   // Unique host ID
              |      +-- timestamp1/         // The job directory
       	      |      |      +-- xxx          // Any output files (stdout, jobid, a.s.o.)
              |      |      +-- yyy
             ...    ...    ...
              |      |      +-- zzz
	      |      +-- timestampN/
	      |      |      +-- xxx
	     ...    ...    ...
              +-- hostidN/
              |      +-- timestamp1/
       	      |      |      +-- xxx
              |      |      +-- yyy
             ...    ...    ...

   The cache directory must be rwx for the user the web server is running as.


** CONFIGURE THE SOURCE:

   Open conf/config.inc and edit its content. Then continue with editing the
   wrapper script include/script.sh, just replace the 'simula ...' line with
   the command.
   
   
** TESTING THE JOB QUEUE:

   A small C-source program (include/simula.c) exist for testing the job
   queue. Compile it with i.e. 'gcc -Wall -O2 simula.c -o simula' it you
   want to test the job queue (its the default command runned from inside
   include/script.sh).
