   Introduction to Batchelor - Batch Job Queue Manager

** GENERAL:

   Batchelor is a web interface written in PHP that provides user to run
   potentional long time jobs under the batch job queue commonly found on
   UNIX/Linux systems. The submit interface allows the input data to the
   batch job to be given in a text field or uploaded as an file.

** HOW IT WORKS:

   Once the input data is uploaded, it queues a batch job running the wrapper
   script (utils/script.sh), passing input data and result directory as
   script arguments. The stderr and stdout is captured to files and can be
   reviewed thru the web frontend or thru the web service API.

** THE CACHE DIRECTORY:

   All jobs (pending, running and finished) are kept under the cache directory
   in a filesystem "database". Each peer has its private namespace (with job
   directories) under cache. Batchelor uses cookies to associate the peer with
   its job directories. 

** USER INTERFACE:

   Since version 0.3.3 its possible to easy change the "look-and-feel" of
   batchelor. All scripts that outputs HTML uses the templates from inside the
   template directory. Copy *.ui.in to *.ui and open *.ui in an editor, change 
   the layout and possible the CSS.

** HOOKS:

   The file include/hooks.inc contains callback functions that lets users
   tailor batchelor to there needs. Among things that can be adopted are:
   indata validation, custom statistics, context help, presentation of result.
   
   The hooks in pair with flexible template UI gives an easy to setup
   solution for allmost everyone. The name (hooks) comes from the fact that
   these functions hooks into the workflow to modify how the system behaves.
   
   In the default configuration theres no hook functions defined, these must
   be explicit enabled by copying include/hooks.inc.in to include/hooks.inc
   and defining the functions of interest.
   
   If the job directory contains a file named 'name', then its content is used
   as the job description in the queue viewer and allows the users to "tag" 
   their jobs. You can i.e. use pre_enqueue_hook() or post_enqueue_hook() to
   set the content of 'name' based on uploaded filename or its data.
   
** STATISTICS:

   Since version 0.6.0 a statistics module has been included. If you like to use
   it, then its recommended to install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) 
   for generating graphics from collected data. 
   
   The collected data (presented by source/statistics.php) is generated by
   running utils/collect.php manual or as a cronjob. The harvesting of statistics
   is incremental by default and thus fairly efficient, but recollection of
   all data can be forced on by using the -f option.
   
** MAINTENANCE:

   Finished jobs can be deleted by running the PHP script named cache.php 
   from the source directory. The job directories to delete can be filtered 
   by date, host/ip-address and hostid. Its better to use this script than 
   the find command, as cache.php has internal knowledge about how the cache 
   is organized.

** JOB CONTROL:

   Since version 0.6.7 it's possible to control running jobs thru the job
   queue viewer. Job control is enabled in conf/config.inc (off by default).
   
   If you like to use job control and is *not* running GNU/Linux, then you
   have to modify the signal values or disaster (and angry users) will 
   follow! 
   
** UPDATE & CONFIG PROTECTION:

   All files ending with *.in are config templates. You are not supposed to edit
   any config templates directly, instead create a copy of the config template 
   with the same name except for the .in extension (like file.inc.in -> file.inc).
   
   A new release will never contain any file.* who has an file.*.in counterpart, 
   thus all file.* are protected when updating.
   
** WEB SERVICES:

   Work on adding web service interfaces where started in version 0.7.x and
   finished in 0.8.0. Currently REST, SOAP, HTTP RCP and XML-RPC is supported. 
   See the file README.WEBSERVICES for more info.
