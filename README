Retrotector is a web interface written in PHP that enables potentional long
running jobs to be uploaded to the server and runned under the batch queue
commonly found on UNIX systems. 

The interface also provides a rudimentary interface where the current state 
of each jobb can be polled, as well as links for removing queued or finished 
jobs.

No effort has been put in creating a good looking UI, as its probably going
to be changed to fit with the overall site design by its users.
