        INSTALL AND CONFIGURE INSTRUCTIONS
    ***********************************************

The requirements for setting up a fully functional installation is minimal, a 
web server with PHP is enough. Special preferences for i.e. cache is possible
to use if wanted.

** REQUIREMENTS:

   	o) Web server (i.e. Apache 2.4.29)
   	o) PHP support (tested with 7.1.x)

** INSTALL:

    It's recommended to use composer to install batchelor:

	bash$> cd /var/www/apps
	bash$> mkdir batchelor2
	bash$> composer require nowise/batchelor

    Run composer update to install batchelor and its dependencies:

	bash$> composer update

    Classic install using tar-ball is also possible, but not recommended as it
    makes it harder to update batchelor.

** SETUP:

    The batchelor.sh script can be used to setup batchelor. Run with --setup should 
    give you a basic setup:

        bash$> ./vendor/bin/batchelor.sh --setup
        (i) Directory config has been setup (please modify the defaults.* files).
        (i) Directory data has been setup (please chmod to web server user).
        (i) File public/.htaccess has been installed (please modify if needed).
        (i) File public/dispatch.php has been installed (please modify if needed).

    Pay attention to the messages and make required changes. The config files might
    need some tweaks and the data directory has to be writable by the web server
    user.

** CONFIGURE:

    You need to provide config protected versions of the config files (*.in):

	bash$> cd config
        bash$> for f in apache.conf auth.inc \
                        defaults.site defaults.app; do \
                cp $f $f.in; \
               done

    Use apache.conf instead of htaccess (found in the public directory) when setting 
    up a production application. For development, use htaccess.

   o) Production:

   	Edit apache.conf and include in your Apache server configuration (i.e. an virtual host 
	definition). Remove any .htaccess inside the public directory:

	bash$> rm public/.htaccess

   o) Development:

	Use the htaccess inside the public directory. Tweak to match your setup as 
        default assumes that /batchelor2 is used as location.

** BUSINESS LOGIC:

    You should now have a basic setup with web services and a user interface. Next
    step is to define your applications business logic. 

    Point your browser at i.e. http://localhost/batchelor-simula/ (or the location were 
    batchelor is setup) and you should be greated with a message that the system is not 
    yet configured. 

    Follow the links to documentation on how to customize user interface and defining
    the tasks that defines your application.
