/**
 * The job data (indata) class.

 * Represent data used as input for an scheduled job. The job data can be plain 
 * data or an download URL. 
 * 
 * To keep things simple (at least for now) we assume that the download URL will 
 * send the data in a format not requiring further processing. At this time we 
 * are only supporting basic authentication encoded in the URL.
 * 
 * The task is the processor that will perform work on the input data. The name
 * must match one of the registered task processors. Most setups have only a single
 * task processor in which case default is a good choice.
