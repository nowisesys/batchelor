    The complete input data is:
</p>
<div class="w3-code w3-border-deep-purple">
    <pre><?= encode(new JobData("hello world", "data", "task1", "Job name")) ?></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>[Required] The <u>data</u> is the input to process. If encoding is required, it has
        to be established by the target task.</li>
    <li>[Required] The <u>type</u> tells what kind of data the data member contains (possible 
        values are 'data' or 'url'). When using url, the data member should contain 
        an HTTP(s) or FTP(s) URL from where data can be downloaded.</li>
    <li>[Optional] The <u>task</u> is the target processor on the server side for processing the 
        input data. This member is optional and default to 'default' task.</li>    
    <li>[Optional] The <u>name</u> is some generic string used to identify the job. It don't 
        affect the job execution and is only used for sorting and search.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Form POST</h5>
<p>
    Sending large files in the data member would be potential slow and error-prone
    and possibly lead to out of memory errors. Therefor its also possible to enqueue 
    jobs by ordinary file POST. The task and name can be set as POST parameters. 
    Use file as identifier, but if unset it should be auto detected on server side.
