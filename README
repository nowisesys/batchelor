Batchelor is a web interface written in PHP that provides user to run
potentional long time jobs under the batch job queue commonly found on
UNIX/Linux systems. The rudimentary interface allows the input data to the
batch job to be given in a text field or uploaded as an file.

Once the input data is uploaded, it queues a batch job running the wrapper
script (utils/script.sh), passing input data and result directory as
script arguments. The stderr and stdout is captured to files and can be
reviewed thru the web interface.

All jobs (pending, running and finished) are keept under the cache directory
in a filesystem "database". Each peer has its private namespace (a job
directory) under cache. Batchelor uses cookies to associate the peer with
its job directory. 

Since version 0.3.3 its possible to easy change the "look-and-feel" of
batchelor. All scripts that outputs HTML uses the templates from inside the
template directory. Open them in an editor, change the layout and possible
the CSS.

Finished jobs can be deleted by running the PHP script named cache.php 
from the source directory. The job directories to delete can be filtered 
by date, host/ip-address and hostid. Its better to use this script than 
the find command, as cache.php has internal knowledge about how the cache 
is organized.
