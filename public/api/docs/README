        ABOUT THE API DOCS

** THE QUEUE API

    The queue API is an integral part of batchelor. This API is used for running, 
    monitor and reading the batch job queue.

    This documentation can be extended with application specific documents (PHP 
    files or plain HTML) by placing files in various places. Search this directory 
    and sub directories for files containing calls to inline(...).

    For example, placing a file named enqueue.inc in the json directory will make
    it included when rendering the json/running view.

** ADDING OTHER API:

    Other custom API can be listed on the index page by placing a file named
    extensions.inc in this directory. The file extensions.inc.in can be used as
    boiler plate code for this.
