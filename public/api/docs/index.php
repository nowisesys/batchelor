<p>
    Job queue management API is implemented using SOAP and JSON providing methods for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Running jobs: enqueue, dequeue, suspend, resume</li>
    <li>Monitor jobs: queue, watch, stat</li>
    <li>Reading results: opendir, readdir, fopen</li>
</ul>

<a class="w3-btn w3-deep-orange" href="json" style="min-width: 90px">JSON</a>
<p>
    As each user can have multiple queues (useful for sharing queues between 
    co-workers) the select method has been added for easy switch between active
    queues.
</p>
<a class="w3-btn w3-green" href="select" style="min-width: 90px">Select</a>
<p>
    Result from listing the queue can be sorted and filtered. PHP don't support
    native enums, so these are described here for all API types.
