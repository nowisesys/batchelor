        INSTALL AND CONFIGURE INSTRUCTIONS
    ***********************************************

The requirements for setting up a fully functional installation is minimal, a 
web server with PHP is enough. Special preferences for i.e. cache is possible
to use if wanted.

** REQUIREMENTS:

   	o) Web server (i.e. Apache 2.4.29)
   	o) PHP support (tested with 7.1.x)

** INSTALL:

    It's recommended to use composer to install batchelor:

	bash$> cd /var/www/apps
	bash$> mkdir batchelor2
	bash$> composer init

    Add the following repository to composer.json:

	"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/proj/sci/batchelor/"
        }
        ],
        "require": {
            "bmc/batchelor": ">=2.0.0"
        }

    Run composer update to install batchelor and its dependencies:

	bash$> composer update

    Classic install using tar-ball is also possible, but not recommended as it
    makes updating harder.

** CONFIGURE:

    You need to provide config protected versions of the config files (*.in):

	bash$> cd config
        bash$> for f in apache.conf auth.inc \
                        defaults.site defaults.app; do \
                cp $f $f.in; \
               done

    Use apache.conf instead of htaccess (found in the public directory) when setting 
    up a production application. For development, use htaccess.

   o) Production:

   	Edit apache.conf and include in your Apache server configuration (i.e. an virtual host 
	definition). Remove any .htaccess inside the public directory:

	bash$> rm public/.htaccess

   o) Development:

	Use the htaccess inside the public directory. Tweak to match your setup as 
        default assumes that /batchelor2 is used as location.
