Example tasks for debugging purpose. Please replace these with your own that you 
register with processor service in config/services.

These examples might seem tedious because they are using the OOP interface for
directory/file operations and running task. Feel free to use standard PHP functions
instead.

The job directory is organized as:

    jobdir/
      +-- result        // save results here
      +-- task1         // the work directory for task1
      +-- task2         // the work directory for task2
     ...
      +-- taskN         // the work directory for taskN

If same task is run multiple times in same executed job instance (same enqeueued
job), make sure to create sub directories under the work directory or use some
naming convention i.e. for task log files.
