=============================================================================
    BATCHELOR - Batch Job Queue Manager 
=============================================================================

This is an web application with buitin web service API for running custom applications


** Requirements:

   	o) Web server (i.e. Apache 2.4.29)
   	o) PHP support (tested with 7.1.x)

** Install:

   It's recommended to use composer to install batchelor, but you can use the tar-ball for
   doing a traditional install.

	bash$> cd /var/www/apps
	bash$> mkdir batchelor2
	bash$> composer init

   Add the following repository to composer.json:

	"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/proj/sci/batchelor/"
        }
        ],
        "require": {
            "bmc/batchelor": ">=2.0.0"
        }

   Run composer update to install batchelor and its dependencies:

	bash$> composer update

** Configure:

   You need to provide config protected versions of the config files (*.in):

	bash$> cd config
	bash$> cp apache.conf.in apache.conf
	bash$> cp auth.inc.in auth.inc
	bash$> cp defaults.site.in defaults.site

   It's recommended to use apache.conf instead of htaccess file (found in the public directory) 
   when setting up a production application. 

   o) Production:

   	Edit apache.conf and include in your Apache server configuration (i.e. an virtual host 
	definition). Remove any .htaccess inside the public directory:

	bash$> rm public/.htaccess

   o) Development:

	Use the htaccess inside the public directory. Tweak to match your setup. The default assumes
	that /batchelor2 is used as location.
