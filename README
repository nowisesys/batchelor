** GENERAL:

   Batchelor is a web interface written in PHP that provides user to run
   potentional long time jobs under the batch job queue commonly found on
   UNIX/Linux systems. The submit interface allows the input data to the
   batch job to be given in a text field or uploaded as an file.

** HOW IT WORKS:

   Once the input data is uploaded, it queues a batch job running the wrapper
   script (utils/script.sh), passing input data and result directory as
   script arguments. The stderr and stdout is captured to files and can be
   reviewed thru the web interface.

** THE CACHE DIRECTORY:

   All jobs (pending, running and finished) are keept under the cache directory
   in a filesystem "database". Each peer has its private namespace (a job
   directory) under cache. Batchelor uses cookies to associate the peer with
   its job directory. 

** USER INTERFACE:

   Since version 0.3.3 its possible to easy change the "look-and-feel" of
   batchelor. All scripts that outputs HTML uses the templates from inside the
   template directory. Open them in an editor, change the layout and possible
   the CSS.

** MAINTENANCE:

   Finished jobs can be deleted by running the PHP script named cache.php 
   from the source directory. The job directories to delete can be filtered 
   by date, host/ip-address and hostid. Its better to use this script than 
   the find command, as cache.php has internal knowledge about how the cache 
   is organized.
