Batchelor is a web interface written in PHP that provides user to run
potentional long time jobs under the batch job queue commonly found on
UNIX/Linux systems. The rudimentary interface allows the input data to the
batch job to be given in a text field or uploaded as an file.

Once the input data is uploaded, it queues a batch job running the wrapper
script (include/script.sh), passing input data and result directory as
script arguments. The stderr and stdout is captured to files and can be
reviewed thru the web interface.

All jobs (pending, running and finished) are keept under the cache directory
in a filesystem "database". Each peer has its private namespace (a job
directory) under cache. Batchelor uses cookies to associate the peer with
its job directory. 

No effort has been put in creating a good looking UI, as I expect the users
of this piece of code to modify the show_form() function to produce HTML
output that conforms with their sites "look-and-feel".
