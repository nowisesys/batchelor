        BATCH JOB QUEUE MANAGER (BATCHELOR)
    *********************************************

Batchelor is an batch job queue manager supporting schdeule task for later 
execution, controlling them and retrieving result. Suitable applications can be
scientific or heavy processing tasks (like media rendering).

** QUEUES:

    The job queue can be accessed thru both a web interface and web services (i.e. 
    SOAP or JSON API). The simpliest configuration uses an local queue, but the 
    installation can be configured as a frontend for multiple remote queues which 
    gives an distributed system with a common interface.

** TASKS:

    Implement one or more classes that defines your application business logic
    and register them with the processor service. An incoming processing request 
    is queued (scheduled for later execution). 

    A background process consumes queued tasks and uses the task registry to find 
    a suitable class (among those registered by you) to process the data. The task
    class is called with input data and working directory.

** END USERS:

    An end user can have multiple personal queues that they can switch between. 
    Theres also support for authentication meant to give authorized users extra 
    powers, for example relaxed upload limits.

** INTEGRATE:

    See the file docs/GETTING-STARTED that contains information for integrators on
    how to configure batchelor to power your applications.
