# The wrapper script. Runs as a batch job under atd (started by batch).
# The script receives three arguments:
# 
# $1 : The directory where job meta data should be saved.
# $2 : The indata file to process.
# $3 : The result directory where output files should go.
#
# This table describe the relation between batchelors job state and 
# the batch queue (system queue) and files created from this script:
#
# +----------------------------------------------+-------------------+
# | files (created here)                         | queue (system)    |

# | stdout | stderr | fatal | started | finished | waiting | running | state    |

# The states in (1) is out of control of this script, it only depends on batch 
# queue properties. The states in (2) is direct affected by this script. Use the 
# qsignal($state, $msg) function to communicate state to batchelor.
#
# NOTES:
#
# 1. Solaris 8 (and later?)
#    a) You need to compile date.c because the system date don't support -u '%s'
#    b) Change first line in this script from /bin/sh to /usr/bin/bash becaue
#       /bin/sh don't understand function xxx() syntax.
#
# 2. Job control:
#    This script support job control by default thru the bgexec() function. If you 
#    don't want job control, then switch to using the fgexec() function instead.
#    Job control must also be enabled in the file conf/config.inc.
#
#    If a complete job is split into several sub-processes, then remember to update
#    the pid-file after each step.
#

## Sanity check:

## Signal started to batchelor:
