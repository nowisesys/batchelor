Place the content of this directory outside the webroot (usually 
/var/lib/http/htdocs). Read the notes inside conf/apache.conf. Make sure 
the directory cache is writable by the user the apache server is running as.

*) The only directory writable by the webserver should be the cache directory.
*) Only source directory should be direct accessable from the web.

All job gets spooled under cache like this:

retrotector
    +-- cache
          +-- uniqueid           
          |    +-- yyyy-mm-dd
          |    |      +-- jobid1
          |    |      +-- jobid2
         ...  ...    ...
          |    |      +-- jobN

By suing the date in the path to the jobX diretory, its easy to write a
script that wipes out directories after a predefined number of days.
