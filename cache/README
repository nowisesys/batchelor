About the cache directory:
------------------------------

** GENERAL:

   This directory is used as cache by default, unless another directory is
   defined by CACHE_DIRECTORY in conf/config.inc. Make sure to change
   permissions on this directory to make it writable by the user the web server
   is running as (usually nobody or a dedicated user named apache or http).

** PRE/POST EXECUTION SCRIPTS:

   To run tasks before or after a queued job is executed, create a script
   named prerun.sh or postrun.sh inside cache/jobs (executed for all jobs) or
   in a specific user directory:

     cache/
       +-- jobs/
             +-- prerun.sh         (for all pre-run script)
	     +-- postrun.sh        (for all post-run script)
	     +-- xxx1/             (user directory 1)
	     +-- xxx2/             (user directory 2)
             |    +-- prerun.sh    (per user pre-run script)
             |    +-- postrun.sh   (per user post-run script)
            ...
	     +-- xxxN/             (user directory N)

   The pre/post run script should have the executable bit set (+x) or it will 
   be silent ignored. All variables exported by utils/script.sh are available 
   for these scripts.

   Typical reasons for using pre/post execution scripts could be: 
   
     o) Process accounting
     o) Backup of result
     o) Extraction of intermediate files
