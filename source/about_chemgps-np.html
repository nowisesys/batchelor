<P>
ChemGPS-NP is a principal component analysis (PCA) based global space map or a chemical global positioning system.
<P>
ChemGPS-NP has eight principal components (dimensions) describing physical-chemical properties such as size, shape,<BR>
polarizability, lipophilicity, polarity, flexibility, rigidity, and hydrogen bond capacity for a reference set of <BR>
compounds. Compounds of interest or under study are positioned onto this map using interpolation in terms of (PCA) <BR>
score prediction. 
<P>
The properties of the compounds together with trends and groupings can easily be interpreted from the resulting projections.
<P>
ChemGPS-NP is tuned for exploration of the regions of chemical space most likely to enclose compounds with <BR>
biologically relevant functions and activities.  Large libraries can for instance be compared without positions <BR>
changing as new structures are included. For instance known inhibitors of a certain target can first be positioned <BR>
on the map and possible active regions of space can be discovered. Full libraries can then be positioned on the <BR>
map and selection of candidates to continue with can be selected from the active region. 
<P>
