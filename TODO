* Publish XML schema for the REST service:
  define("WS_REST_SCHEMA_URL", "http://it.bmc.uu.se/batchelor/rest/200801");

* Fix SOAP. It's not actually functional in its current state. The request
  seems to go thru (function gets called on server side), but the response
  to the client is always empty. The WSDL was generated by Apache Axis,
  maybe it needs to be replaced by an hand crafted one?
