<span id="secthead">About ChemGPS-NP</span>
<p>ChemGPS-NP is a principal component analysis (PCA) based global space map or a chemical global positioning system.</p>
<p>ChemGPS-NP has eight principal components (dimensions) describing physical-chemical properties such as size, shape, polarizability, lipophilicity, polarity, flexibility, rigidity, and hydrogen bond capacity for a reference set of compounds. Compounds of interest or under study are positioned onto this map using interpolation in terms of (PCA) score prediction.</p>
<p>The properties of the compounds together with trends and groupings can easily be interpreted from the resulting projections.</p>
<p>ChemGPS-NP is tuned for exploration of the regions of chemical space most likely to enclose compounds with biologically relevant functions and activities.  Large libraries can for instance be compared without positions changing as new structures are included. For instance known inhibitors of a certain target can first be positioned on the map and possible active regions of space can be discovered. Full libraries can then be positioned on the map and selection of candidates to continue with can be selected from the active region.
