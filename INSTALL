** GENERAL:

   Place the content of this directory outside the webroot (usually 
   /var/lib/http/htdocs). Read the notes inside conf/apache.conf. Make sure 
   the directory cache is writable by the user the apache server is running as.

   *) The only directory writable by the webserver should be the cache directory.
   *) Only source directory should be direct accessable from the web.

   Example:
   
   /var/lib/http/
             +-- apps/                      // Webapps like batchelor goes here
	     |     +-- batchelor/
	     |             +-- cache/       // Can be moved, see conf/config.inc 
	     |             +-- conf/
	     |             +-- include/  
	     |             +-- source/      // Aliased in Apache conf, see conf/apache.conf
	     |             +-- utils/       // Contains the command wrapper script.sh
	     |             +-- template/    // UI templates (modify at will).
	     +-- cgi-bin/
	     +-- htdocs/                    // The standard webroot, plain HTML
	     +-- error/                     // Apache internal
	     +-- icons/                     // Apache internal


** REQUIREMENTS:

   The code has been tested to work with:
   
   *) PHP 5.2.4 (PHP 4.4.x is being phased out, see http://www.php.net/)
   *) Apache 2.2.6 (http://httpd.apache.org/)
   *) The UNIX at daemon 3.1.8 (ftp://jurix.jura.uni-sb.de/pub/jurix/source/chroot/appl/at/)
   
   The PECL zip extension (bundled with PHP >= 5.2.x) is recommended. The
   code is also prepared to use an external zip command, like 7-zip. 7-zip is
   GPL/BSD licensed and can be downloaded from http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/.

   Its recommended to install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you
   plan to use the statistics module. Without it, all statistics is
   presented as plain text.
   
   The code is developed and tested on Gentoo Linux 2007.0 and getting it to run
   on any other UNIX/Linux shouldn't be any problem. Windows may be tricky due to 
   the tight interaction with the batch queue (at/atrm/atd).
   

** THE CACHE DIRECTORY:

   All job gets spooled under cache like this:

   batchelor/
        +-- cache/
              +-- hostid1/                   // Unique host ID
              |      +-- timestamp1/         // The job directory
       	      |      |      +-- xxx          // Any output files (stdout, jobid, a.s.o.)
              |      |      +-- yyy
             ...    ...    ...
              |      |      +-- zzz
	      |      +-- timestampN/
	      |      |      +-- xxx
	     ...    ...    ...
              +-- hostidN/
              |      +-- timestamp1/
       	      |      |      +-- xxx
              |      |      +-- yyy
             ...    ...    ...

   The cache directory must be rwx for the user the web server is running as.


** CONFIGURE THE SOURCE:

   Open conf/config.inc and edit its content. Then continue with editing the
   wrapper script utils/script.inc, just replace the 'simula ...' line with
   the command you want to run.

   Its recommended that you enable the HTTP RPC web service as its used with
   Ajax technology to automatic refresh the queue view whenever its state
   changes.

   Check your installation by pointing a browser at http://localhost/batchelor/check.php
   or run it from inside the source directory as 'php check.php'.
   
** TESTING THE JOB QUEUE:

   A small C-source program (include/simula.c) exist for testing the job
   queue. Compile it with i.e. 'gcc -Wall -O2 simula.c -o simula' it you
   want to test the job queue (its the default command runned from inside
   include/script.sh).
